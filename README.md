Design of a 5MW PV Plant-Grid Connected
 5 MW Grid-Connected Solar PV Plant – NSW, Australia

 Location: Near Wallsend, New South Wales, Australia  
Course: 7405ENG – Renewable Energy Systems  
 Institution: Griffith School of Engineering, Griffith University  

  Project Overview
This project presents the design, modelling, and financial evaluation of a 5 MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant located near Wallsend, NSW.  
The study supports Australia’s transition to renewable energy and aligns with NSW Net Zero targets and Australia’s 2050 net-zero emissions commitment.

The system was modelled using RETScreen Expert, covering:
- Energy production
- Cost and lifecycle analysis
- Emission reduction benefits
- Financial feasibility
